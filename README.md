# Plant Disease Classifier

A deep learning–based Plant Disease Classifier built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset with preprocessing, image augmentation, and evaluation metrics to ensure high accuracy and robust performance.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model for disease classification
- Training, validation, and testing pipeline
- Prediction script for new images
- Achieved high accuracy on PlantVillage dataset
